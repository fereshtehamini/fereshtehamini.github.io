	  	I am a Data Visualization Specialist at Microsoft in Redmond, where I research and design information visualizations to extract and 
	  	communicate data-driven insights. I am also a lecturer at UCBerkeley Information School, where I teach Information 
	  	Visualization and Communication course as part of the Data Science program.

	  	under the supervision of <a href='http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~irani/'>Dr. Pourang Irani</a>. 
		I designed and conducted quantitative and qualitative research on information visualization tools and techniques for 
	  	data storytelling to broad audiences.
